# ESP8266 ISO14443A card reader

This project uses an ESP8266 NodeMCU board and a PN532 NFC module. The board reads an ISO14443A cards and communicates with a backend server, which authorizes or denies access according to the UID value contained on the card chip.

**The communication with the server is incomplete and TBA.**

## Required hardware:
- ESP8266 NodeMCU WiFi Development Board
   - user manual: https://handsontec.com/dataspecs/module/esp8266-V13.pdf
- PN532 NFC RFID Module
  - Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Communication-Arduino-Raspberry-Android/dp/B01I1J17LC
  - user manual: http://www.elechouse.com/elechouse/images/product/PN532_module_V3/PN532_%20Manual_V3.pdf

## Required software:
- Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
- PN532 library: https://github.com/elechouse/PN532
- Arduino_JSON library: https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_JSON (also downloadable within Arduino IDE)
- ESP8266 board installed in Arduino IDE

## Setup:
1. Make sure the switch on the NFC module is set to use the SPI interfece:
   
| Channel 1 | Channel 2 |
|:---------:|:---------:|
| OFF       | ON        |

2. Connect these pins on the NFC module SPI interface to the board as following:

| PN532 Module | ESP8266 Board |
|:------------:|:-------------:|
| GND          | G             |
| VCC          | 3V            |
| SCK          | D5            |
| MISO         | D6            |
| MOSI         | D7            |
| SS           | D0            |

3. Install and setup the ESP8266 board in Arduino IDE - more info can be found in the board user manual: https://handsontec.com/dataspecs/module/esp8266-V13.pdf
4. Download and include all the required libraries in the Arduino IDE sketch.
5. In 'src/main.ino' redefine 'WIFI_SSID' and 'WIFI_PASSWORD' constants to match with your WiFi.
6. Flash.
